                <h2>Overview of Testing Frameworks</h2>
                
                <h3>Playwright</h3>
                <p>
                    Microsoft's Playwright, released in 2020, has quickly gained popularity due to its modern architecture and powerful features. It's designed to be reliable and capable of automating modern web apps across all major browsers.
                </p>

                <h3>Cypress</h3>
                <p>
                    Cypress, introduced in 2014, revolutionized front-end testing with its developer-friendly approach and real-time testing capabilities. It's built for modern web applications and provides excellent debugging features.
                </p>

                <h3>Selenium</h3>
                <p>
                    Selenium, the veteran in the field since 2004, remains widely used across the industry. It's known for its flexibility, extensive language support, and large community.

            <section id="conclusion">
                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>
                    Each framework has its strengths and ideal use cases. Playwright is excellent for modern web applications requiring cross-browser testing, Cypress shines in JavaScript projects with its developer experience, and Selenium remains a solid choice for projects needing extensive language support or legacy application testing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Consider your project's specific needs, team expertise, and long-term maintenance requirements when making your choice. For modern web applications, both Playwright and Cypress offer significant advantages over Selenium in terms of reliability and ease of use.
