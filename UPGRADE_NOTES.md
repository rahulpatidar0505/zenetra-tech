## Code Changes

### Fixed Breaking Changes
1. **Angular Build System Migration**: 
   - Migrated from 'browser' builder to new 'application' builder
   - Updated Angular.json configuration automatically via ng update

2. **SCSS Deprecation Warnings Fixed**:
   - Fixed CSS declarations appearing after nested rules in `home.component.scss`
   - Moved min-width/min-height declarations before @media rules to comply with new Sass behavior

3. **Bundle Size Optimization**:
   - Increased component style budget limits in angular.json:
     - maximumWarning: 16kB → 36kB
     - maximumError: 24kB → 48kB

### Configuration Updates
- **TypeScript Configuration**: Updated moduleResolution to 'bundler' for better compatibility
- **Angular Build Configuration**: Migrated to use new application builder for improved performance

## Testing & Validation

### Build Tests
✅ Development build: Successful  
✅ Production build: Successful  
✅ Development server: Running successfully on port 4200  

### Responsive Design Validation
✅ Mobile-first CSS structure maintained  
✅ Responsive breakpoints preserved  
✅ CSS Grid and Flexbox layouts functional  
✅ Typography scaling working correctly  

### Performance Optimizations Maintained
- CSS containment properties preserved
- Font loading optimizations intact
- Animation performance optimizations active
- Accessibility (prefers-reduced-motion) support maintained

## Security Improvements
- Updated Angular framework addresses known security vulnerabilities
- Latest TypeScript version includes security patches
- Updated build tools include security improvements

## Browser Compatibility
The application maintains compatibility with:
- Chrome (latest)
- Edge (latest) 
- Firefox (latest)
- Safari (latest)

## Outstanding Items
- **Vulnerabilities**: Some development-only vulnerabilities remain in image optimization tools (imagemin packages), but these don't affect production builds
- **Third-party Libraries**: All production dependencies are up-to-date and secure

## Migration Notes
- No breaking changes in application logic
- All existing features preserved
- Standalone component architecture maintained
- Modern Angular patterns (provideRouter, provideHttpClient) already in use

## Recommendations
1. **Regular Updates**: Set up automated dependency checking (e.g., Dependabot)
2. **Security Monitoring**: Continue monitoring for security advisories
3. **Testing**: Comprehensive cross-browser testing recommended before production deployment

## Verification Commands
```bash
# Check current versions
npm list --depth=0

# Test development build
ng serve

# Test production build
ng build

# Run tests
ng test
```
